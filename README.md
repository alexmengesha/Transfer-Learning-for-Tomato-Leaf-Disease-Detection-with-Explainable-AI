# Transfer-Learning-for-Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Detection-with-Explainable-AI
## Objective:This study aims to improve tomato leaf disease detection by developing accurate, transparent deep learning models using pre-trained CNN architectures 
## Method
- Collected 523 images of tomato leaves from four irrigation sites in Dehana woreda, Ethiopia, and augmented the dataset to 3,138 images.
- Applied basic image preprocessing techniques to improve dataset quality.
- Split the dataset into training (70%), validation (10%), and testing (20%) sets.
- Implemented pre-trained CNN architectures (MobileNetV3, InceptionV3, DenseNet201) on Google Colab with GPU processing.
- Integrated Explainable AI methods to ensure model transparency.
